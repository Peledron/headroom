"""Prefix Cache Tracker — session-scoped state for cache-aware compression.

Tracks provider prefix cache state between turns so the transform pipeline
can freeze already-cached messages and only compress new content.

Problem: Clients like Claude Code already manage prefix caching (up to 4
cache_control breakpoints, growing-prefix strategy). If Headroom compresses
or modifies messages in the cached prefix, it invalidates the cache —
replacing a 90% read discount (Anthropic) or 50% (OpenAI) with a 25%
write penalty.

Solution: After each API response, record how many tokens the provider
cached. On the next turn, freeze that many messages so the transform
pipeline skips them entirely.

    Two forces pile up cache_control markers turn over turn: clients move the
    breakpoint to the newest message each call, and ``overlay_cached_prefix``
    replays the markers that rode on each turn's then-newest message. Anthropic
    hard-errors at **>4 cache_control blocks total** (system + tools + messages),
    so on a long conversation the accumulation eventually 400s.

    Fix: strip EVERY message-level cache_control and re-place a **single**
    ephemeral breakpoint. One breakpoint caches the whole message prefix up to
    it, and because the provider's cache key is message CONTENT, not marker
    presence (moving the breakpoint forward is the documented client pattern and
    it hits), stripping and re-placing markers never busts. system/tools
    breakpoints live outside ``messages`` and are left untouched (they still
    count toward the 4 limit, so holding messages to one breakpoint leaves room
    for them).

    WHERE that one breakpoint goes is the last block of the last block-style
    message, except when that message grew IN PLACE since last turn. Sub-call
    shapes pack a transcript into one block-style message and rewrite its tail
    each turn, so a breakpoint on its newest block can never match next turn and
    pins ``cache_read`` at the system+tools constant forever, however stable the
    rest of the message is. When ``previous_forwarded_messages`` shows that the
    same message diverged partway through, the breakpoint is anchored to the end
    of its byte-stable leading run instead: that boundary IS cached, so the run
    reads from cache and the breakpoint advances one turn behind the growth.

    Relocation only fires when the stable run covers most of the message
    (otherwise anchoring backwards would cache less than it saves) and only for
    the same message position and role, so a main conversation whose newest
    message is genuinely new each turn keeps the newest-block placement.
    ``HEADROOM_STABLE_BOUNDARY_BREAKPOINT=0`` restores it unconditionally.

    Headroom owns WHERE the breakpoint goes; the client still owns WHAT it says:
    the re-placed marker reuses the newest client marker verbatim, so an explicit
    ``ttl`` (e.g. ``"1h"``) survives consolidation instead of silently
    downgrading to the 5-minute default (#2375).

    ``force_ttl`` overrides the ttl written onto that single re-placed breakpoint.
    The default (None) reuses the client's marker verbatim (the #2375 behavior
    above), which is right for a long-lived main session that may idle past 5
    minutes. A caller that knows the request is short-lived and non-resuming (a
    Claude Code sub-agent, measured median ~3 min) passes ``force_ttl="5m"`` so
    the message-prefix writes land in the 1.25x tier instead of the 2x 1h tier
    the client would otherwise pay for retention the sub-agent never uses. ttl is
    a pure retention/cost knob and the provider keys the cache on content not
    ttl, so this only changes write price and retention, never the response or a
    hit.

        Depth is the last thing that matters, and the reason this returns a
