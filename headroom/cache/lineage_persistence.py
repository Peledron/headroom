"""Cross-restart persistence for SessionTrackerStore lineages.

``SessionTrackerStore`` keeps every lineage in memory, so restarting the proxy
loses ``prev_orig`` and ``prev_fwd`` for every live session.
``overlay_cached_prefix`` then has nothing to replay and each session rewrites
its whole history at the provider's 1.25x write rate. Measured on 2026-07-25 at
roughly 195k write tokens per restart, which is a standing tax on shipping any
fix at all.

This module is only the file layer: snapshot in, snapshot out, atomically and
off the request path. What belongs in a snapshot is decided by
``SessionTrackerStore.export_state``.

Two properties matter more than speed here. The write must be atomic, because a
truncated snapshot would restore a partial history and every later turn would
compare against a prefix that was never actually forwarded. And nothing in this
module may raise into the caller: a persistence failure has to degrade to the
old in-memory behavior, never fail the turn it was trying to make cheaper.
